[]{#_Toc71028296 .anchor}Introduction

[]{#_Toc71028297 .anchor}Scope of study

Mathematics is the study of function and pattern in number, logic, space and structure, and of randomness, chance, variability, and uncertainty in data and events. It is both a framework for thinking and a means of symbolic communication that is powerful, logical, concise and precise. Mathematics also provides a means by which people can understand and manage human and natural aspects of the world and interrelationships between these. Essential mathematical activities include conjecturing, hypothesising and problem-posing; estimating, calculating, computing and constructing; abstracting, proving, refuting and inferring; applying, investigating, modelling and problem-solving.

[]{#_Toc71028298 .anchor}Rationale

This study is designed to provide access to worthwhile and challenging mathematical learning in a way\
which takes into account the interests, needs, dispositions and aspirations of a wide range of students, and introduces them to key aspects of the discipline and its applications. It is also designed to promote students' awareness of the importance of mathematics in everyday life in a technological society and globalised world, and to develop confidence and the disposition to make effective use of mathematical concepts, processes and skills in practical and theoretical contexts.

[]{#_Toc71028299 .anchor}Aims

This study enables students to:

-   develop mathematical concepts, key knowledge and key skills

-   apply mathematics to analyse, investigate and model a variety of contexts and solve practical and theoretical problems in situations that range from well-defined and familiar to open-ended and unfamiliar

-   apply computational thinking and algorithms, and use technology effectively as a tool for working mathematically.

[]{#_Toc71028300 .anchor}Structure

The study is made up of the following units:

-   Foundation Mathematics Units 1--4

-   General Mathematics Units 1--4

-   Mathematical Methods Units 1--4

-   Specialist Mathematics Units 1--4

Each unit covers specific content contained in areas of study and is designed to enable students to achieve a set of outcomes for that unit. Each outcome is described in terms of key knowledge and key skills.\
A glossary defining terms used across Units 1 to 4 in the *VCE Mathematics Study Design* is included in the Support materials*.*

The areas of study from which content is drawn as applicable to each unit are: Algebra, number and structure; Calculus; Data analysis, probability and statistics; Discrete Mathematics; Functions, relations and graphs; and Space and measurement.

Units 1--4 have been developed as a sequence, with Units 1 and 2 covering assumed key knowledge and key skills as preparation for Units 3 and 4.

**Foundation Mathematics Units 1--4** provide for the continuing mathematical development of students with respect to problems encountered in practical contexts in everyday life at home, in the community, at work and in study.

**General Mathematics Units 1--4** provide for the study of non-calculus and discrete mathematics topics. They are designed to be widely accessible and provide preparation for general employment, business or further study, in particular where data analysis, recursion and financial modelling, networks and matrices are important. Students who have done only Mathematical Methods Units 1 and 2 will have had access to assumed key knowledge and key skills for General Mathematics Units 3 and 4 but may also need to undertake some supplementary study.

**Mathematical Methods Units 1--4** provide for the study of simple elementary functions, transformations and combinations of these functions, algebra, calculus, probability and statistics, and their applications in a variety of practical and theoretical contexts. They also provide background for further study in, for example, science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), humanities, economics and medicine.

**Specialist Mathematics Units 1--4** provide for the study of various mathematical structures, reasoning and proof. The areas of study in Units 3 and 4 extend content from Mathematical Methods Units 3 and 4 to include rational and other quotient functions as well as other advanced mathematics topics such as logic and proof, complex numbers, vectors, differential equations, kinematics, and statistical inference. They also provide background for advanced studies in mathematics and other STEM fields. Study of Specialist Mathematics Units 3 and 4 assumes concurrent study or previous completion of Mathematical Methods\
Units 3 and 4.

[]{#_Toc71028301 .anchor}Entry

There are no prerequisites for entry to Units 1, 2 and 3; however, students undertaking Mathematical Methods Units 1 and 2 or Specialist Mathematics Units 1 and 2 are assumed to have a sound background in number, algebra, function, geometry, probability and statistics. Students must undertake Unit 3 and Unit 4 as a sequence. Units 1 to 4 are designed to a standard equivalent to the final two years of secondary education. All VCE studies are benchmarked against comparable national and international curriculum.

Enrolment in Specialist Mathematics Units 3 and 4 assumes a current enrolment in, or previous completion of, Mathematical Methods Units 3 and 4.

[]{#_Toc71028302 .anchor}Duration

Each unit involves at least 50 hours of scheduled classroom instruction.

[]{#_Toc71028303 .anchor}Changes to the study design

During its period of accreditation minor changes to the study will be announced in the [*VCAA Bulletin*](https://www.vcaa.vic.edu.au/news-and-events/bulletins-and-updates/bulletin/Pages/index.aspx). The Bulletin is the only source of changes to regulations and accredited studies. It is the responsibility of each VCE teacher to monitor changes or advice about VCE studies published in the Bulletin.

[]{#_Toc71028304 .anchor}Monitoring for quality

As part of ongoing monitoring and quality assurance, the VCAA will periodically undertake an audit of\
VCE Mathematics to ensure the study is being taught and assessed as accredited. The details of the audit procedures and requirements are published annually in the [*VCE and VCAL Administrative Handbook*](https://www.vcaa.vic.edu.au/administration/vce-vcal-handbook/Pages/index.aspx). Schools will be notified if they are required to submit material to be audited.

[]{#_Toc71028305 .anchor}Safety and wellbeing

It is the responsibility of the school to ensure that duty of care is exercised in relation to the health and safety of all students undertaking the study.

[]{#_Toc71028306 .anchor}Employability skills

This study offers a number of opportunities for students to develop employability skills. The *Advice for teacher's* companion document provides specific examples of how students can develop employability skills during learning activities and assessment tasks.

[]{#_Toc71028307 .anchor}Legislative compliance

When collecting and using information, the provisions of privacy and copyright legislation, such as the Victorian *Privacy and Data Protection Act 2014* and *Health Records Act 2001*, and the federal *Privacy Act 1988* and *Copyright Act 1968*, must be met.

Child Safe Standards

Schools and education and training providers are required to comply with the Child Safe Standards made under the Victorian *Child Wellbeing and Safety Act 2005*. Registered schools are required to comply with *Ministerial Order No. 1359 Implementing the Child Safe Standards -- Managing the Risk of Child Abuse in Schools and School Boarding Premises*. For further information, consult the websites of the [Victorian Registration and Qualifications Authority](https://www.vrqa.vic.gov.au/childsafe/Pages/Home.aspx), the [Commission for Children and Young People](https://ccyp.vic.gov.au/) and the [Department of Education and Training](https://www2.education.vic.gov.au/pal/child-safe-standards/policy).

[]{#_Toc71028308 .anchor}Assessment and reporting

[]{#_Toc71028309 .anchor}Satisfactory completion

The award of satisfactory completion for a unit is based on the teacher's decision that the student has demonstrated achievement of the set of outcomes specified for the unit. Demonstration of achievement of outcomes and satisfactory completion of a unit are determined by evidence gained through the assessment of a range of learning activities and tasks.

Teachers must develop courses that provide appropriate opportunities for students to demonstrate achievement of the set of outcomes.

The decision about satisfactory completion of a unit is distinct from the assessment of levels of achievement. Schools will report a student's result for each unit to the VCAA as S (satisfactory) or N (not Satisfactory).

[]{#_Toc71028310 .anchor}Levels of achievement

Units 1 and 2

Procedures for the assessment of levels of achievement in Units 1 and 2 are a matter for school decision. Assessment of levels of achievement for these units will not be reported to the VCAA. Schools may choose to report levels of achievement using grades, descriptive statements or other indicators.

Units 3 and 4

The VCAA specifies the assessment procedures for students undertaking scored assessment in Units 3\
and 4. Designated assessment tasks are provided in the details for each unit in VCE study designs.

The student's level of achievement in Units 3 and 4 will be determined by School-assessed Coursework (SAC) as specified in the VCE study design, and external assessment.

The VCAA will report the student's level of achievement on each assessment component as a grade from A+ to E or UG (ungraded). To receive a study score the student must achieve two or more graded assessments in the study and receive an S for both Units 3 and 4. The study score is reported on a scale of 0--50; it is a measure of how well the student performed in relation to all others who took the study. Teachers should refer to the current [*VCE and VCAL Administrative Handbook*](https://www.vcaa.vic.edu.au/administration/vce-vcal-handbook/Pages/index.aspx) for details on graded assessment and calculation of the study score. Percentage contributions to the study score in VCE Mathematics are as follows:

**Foundation Mathematics**

Unit 3 School-assessed Coursework: 40 per cent

Unit 4 School-assessed Coursework: 20 per cent

Units 3 and 4 Examination: 40 per cent.

**General Mathematics**

Unit 3 School-assessed Coursework: 24 per cent

Unit 4 School-assessed Coursework: 16 per cent

Units 3 and 4 Examination 1: 30 per cent

Examination 1 for Mathematical Methods and Examination 1 for Specialist Mathematics are technology-free examinations. All other VCE mathematics examinations assume student access to VCAA approved technology.

Details of the assessment program are described in the sections on Units 3 and 4 in this study design.

[]{#_Toc71028311 .anchor}Authentication

Work related to the outcomes of each unit will be accepted only if the teacher can attest that, to the best of their knowledge, all unacknowledged work is the student's own. Teachers need to refer to the current [*VCE and VCAL Administrative Handbook*](https://www.vcaa.vic.edu.au/administration/vce-vcal-handbook/Pages/index.aspx) for authentication rules and strategies.

[]{#_Toc71028312 .anchor}Unit 1: Foundation Mathematics

Foundation Mathematics Units 1 and 2 focus on providing students with the mathematical knowledge, skills, understanding and dispositions to solve problems in real contexts for a range of workplace, personal, further learning, and community settings relevant to contemporary society. They are also designed as preparation for Foundation Mathematics Units 3 and 4 and contain assumed knowledge and skills for these units.

In Unit 1 students consolidate mathematical foundations, further develop their knowledge and capability to plan and conduct activities independently and collaboratively, communicate their mathematical ideas, and acquire mathematical knowledge skills to make informed decisions in their lives. The areas of study for Foundation Mathematics Unit 1 are 'Algebra, number and structure', 'Data analysis, probability and statistics', 'Discrete mathematics', and 'Space and measurement'. The content should be developed using contexts present in students' other studies, work and personal or other familiar situations.

In undertaking these units, students are expected to be able to apply techniques, routines and processes involving integer, rational and real arithmetic, sets, lists and tables, contemporary data displays, diagrams, plans, geometric objects and constructions, algorithms, measures, equations and graphs, with and without the use of technology. They should have facility with relevant mental and by-hand approaches to estimation and computation. The use of numerical, graphical, geometric, symbolic, statistical and financial functionality of technology for teaching and learning mathematics, for working mathematically, and in related assessment, is to be incorporated throughout each unit as applicable.

[]{#_Toc71028048 .anchor}Mathematical investigation

This comprises one to two weeks of investigation into one or two practical or theoretical contexts or scenarios based on content from areas of study and application of key knowledge and key skills for the outcomes.

Investigation is to be incorporated in the development of concepts, skills and processes for the unit, and can be used to assess the outcomes.

There are three components to mathematical investigation:

Formulation

Overview of the context or scenario, and related background, including historical or contemporary background as applicable, and the mathematisation of questions, conjectures, hypotheses, issues or problems of interest.

Exploration

Investigation and analysis of the context or scenario with respect to the questions of interest, conjectures or hypotheses, using mathematical concepts, skills and processes, including the use of technology and application of computational thinking.

Communication

Summary, presentation and interpretation of the findings from the mathematical investigation and related applications.

Possible contexts or scenarios

Some possible contexts or scenarios for the mathematical investigation in Unit 1 include:

-   Planning and costing for a day trip, including route planning and costing using public transport.

    Determining the location and modes of transport, addresses formulating the problem. For the exploration aspects of the problem, devising and costing a plan for the day, including key times, travel time and costings. Alternative itineraries could be incorporated in case of unforeseen delays. Results can be communicated in the form of a detailed itinerary incorporating a map and the costings.

-   Collecting, reporting and analysing sports performance data or analysing and comparing population densities of business areas, suburbs and regions in a city or state.

    Formulating the problem includes selecting and finding the relevant sports performance data or the areas to analyse in relation to population densities. Undertaking a statistical analysis of the data would be covered in the exploration phase, where suitable methods of data analysis and representation are selected and used. A report summarising the outcomes of analysis, and any interpretation and reflections on the results addresses the communication phases of the investigation.

-   Calculating and comparing the amount of tax to be paid on different incomes, comparing PAYG rates and company rates.

    Investigating different taxation rates requires research based on the different taxation tables available on the ATO website and selection of a range of different income brackets. The exploration phase requires the use of different taxation brackets to calculate the taxation amounts to be paid and possible comparison with business taxation tables. The final component of the investigation would be the communication of the results via a report or presentation.

-   Workplace task requirements such as mathematical measurements and use of formulas required for a specific job or task.

> This could consider the context of painting a room at home or in the school. Formulating the problem requires selecting the room or rooms to be painted, deciding on which walls or ceilings would be painted, and selecting the paints to be used. The exploration stage involves measuring the walls and ceilings and determining the requirements for a tradesperson. Results can be communicated in the form of a detailed quotation for painting works to be carried out.

Possible contexts or scenarios

Some possible contexts or scenarios for the mathematical investigation in Unit 2 include:

> For an investigation into house rental options, formulation involves finding and selecting several rental house options from the internet, and deciding how to best compare the properties using, for example, the weekly and monthly payments. This could include, for example, deciding to use spreadsheets to compare options. The exploration phase includes entering relevant data and information into the spreadsheets and undertaking any calculations in order to compare the properties. This could also incorporate doing a budget to see what rentals could be afforded. Results could be communicated as a client report.

-   Calculating and comparing the costs and charges for different utilities (e.g. phone plans, gas or electricity plans).

    Based around sets of anonymised utility bills and plans available on the internet from different providers, formulate how to analyse and compare the costs and charges for different utilities. Once a decision has been made on how to undertake the research and against what criteria, the exploration component would see an analysis of the bills to understand and compare the breakdown of charges and rates, potentially using spreadsheets to document and undertake the analysis. The analysis and the results could then be communicated in the third investigation component through a report that incorporated a comparative table.

-   Comparing HECS-HELP and VET student loan schemes or analyse and compare interest charged under different borrowing schemes, in terms of amount and length of financial commitment, and servicing requirements.

    An example could be to consider how to purchase a car funded through different borrowing schemes. The formulation stage would involve decisions about available budgets, which car and from which suppliers, and establishing what financial parameters needed to be considered. In the exploration stage a cost analysis of different products would be undertaken, including comparing different interest rates over different time frames. Results could be presented as recommendations for different options, detailing their mathematical reasons.

-   Creating plans for the construction of an object such as a child's cubby house, school garden, or the design, costing and construction of new packaging for a product.

    In the example of designing a child's cubby house, formulation of the problem would include the initial investigations about design, size, dimensions, and cost. The second stage would explore the problem, creating designs and models using scale drawing techniques. This stage might also cost the project. The design could be communicated as a set of useable plans with associated specifications and costings.

[]{#_Toc71028357 .anchor}Mathematical investigation

This comprises one to two weeks of investigation into one or two practical or theoretical contexts or scenarios based on content from areas of study and application of key knowledge and key skills for the outcomes.

Investigation is to be incorporated in the development of concepts, skills and processes for the unit, and can be used to assess the outcomes.

There are three components to mathematical investigation:

Formulation

Overview of the context or scenario, and related background, including historical or contemporary background as applicable, and the mathematisation of questions, conjectures, hypotheses, issues or problems of interest.

Exploration

Investigation and analysis of the context or scenario with respect to the questions of interest, conjectures or hypotheses, using mathematical concepts, skills and processes, including the use of technology and application of computational thinking.

Communication

Summary, presentation and interpretation of the findings from the mathematical investigation and related applications.

Possible contexts or scenarios

Some possible contexts or scenarios for the mathematical investigation in Unit 1 include:

-   A practical or theoretical situation in which a curve passing through points on the plane is modelled by the graph of a polynomial function of low degree. This could involve exploring what information can be used to determine the equation of a linear, quadratic or cubic function, and what graphs can be found to fit particular sets of information. Key features of families of graphs that fit a particular set of information could also be explored. For example, a family of quadratic functions with a leading coefficient equal to 1, whose graph contain the points with coordinates $(0,\ 0)$ and $( - 2,\ k)$. By systematically varying $k$, the effect of $k$ on the behaviour of the graph of the quadratic function could be explored.

-   Combinatorial counting problems and their application to probability in games of chance. This could involve using technology to simulate simple card game problems and comparing the simulation results with theoretical probabilities obtained using combinatorial counting techniques. For example, simulating drawing two cards at random from a standard pack and estimating the probability that they are of the same suit. Alternatively, using simulation to estimate probabilities that are more complicated to calculate theoretically, such as (i) derangements (the rearrangement of the elements of a set such that no element appears in its original position), or (ii) the probability of selecting a particular 'poker hand' when five cards are drawn at random from a standard pack.

-   Exploration of graphical, algebraic and numerical methods and algorithms for finding the roots of a polynomial function and their accuracy and efficiency. This could include using graphical, spreadsheet and dynamic geometry functionalities of technology to observe multiple representations of convergence towards the root of a polynomial function by successive iterations of the bisection method. For each iteration, an interval is bisected and a subinterval in which a root must lie is selected for further processing. A possible extension is to analyse the pseudocode for the bisection method algorithm and use it to assist in writing a program to run the bisection method algorithm on a selected technology.

Satisfactory completion

The award of satisfactory completion for a unit is based on whether the student has demonstrated achievement of the set of outcomes specified for the unit. Teachers should use a variety of learning activities and assessment tasks to provide a range of opportunities for students to demonstrate the key knowledge and key skills in the outcomes.

The areas of study and key knowledge and key skills listed for the outcomes should be used for course design and the development of learning activities and assessment tasks.

Assessment of levels of achievement

The student's level of achievement for Units 3 and 4 will be determined by a combination of School-assessed Coursework and an External assessment. The School-assessed Coursework will contribute 60 per cent and the examination will contribute 40 per cent to the study score.

School-assessed Coursework tasks must be a part of the regular teaching and learning program and must not unduly add to the workload associated with that program. They must be completed mainly in class and within a limited timeframe.

Where teachers provide a range of options for the same School-assessed Coursework task, they should ensure that the options are of comparable scope and demand.

The types and range of forms of School-assessed Coursework for the outcomes are prescribed within the study design. The VCAA publishes Support materials for this study, which includes advice on the design of assessment tasks and the assessment of student work for a level of achievement.

Teachers will provide to the VCAA a numerical score representing an assessment of the student's level of achievement. The score must be based on the teacher's assessment of the performance of each student on the tasks set out in the following table.

Where teachers allow students to choose between tasks, they must ensure that the tasks they set are of comparable scope and demand.

Contribution to final assessment

[]{#_Toc71028390 .anchor}Units 3 and 4: General Mathematics

General Mathematics Units 3 and 4 focus on real-life application of mathematics and consist of the areas of study 'Data analysis, probability and statistics' and 'Discrete mathematics'.

Unit 3 comprises *Data analysis* and *Recursion and financial modelling*, and Unit 4 comprises *Matrices* and *Networks and decision mathematics*.

Assumed knowledge and skills for General Mathematics Units 3 and 4 are contained in General Mathematics Units 1 and 2, and will be drawn on, as applicable, in the development of related content from the areas of study, and key knowledge and key skills for the outcomes of General Mathematics Units 3 and 4.

In undertaking these units, students are expected to be able to apply techniques, routines and processes involving rational and real arithmetic, sets, lists, tables and matrices, diagrams, networks, algorithms, algebraic manipulation, recurrence relations, equations and graphs. They should have facility with relevant mental and by-hand approaches to estimation and computation. The use of numerical, graphical, geometric, symbolic statistical and financial functionality of technology for teaching and learning mathematics, for working mathematically, and in related assessment, is to be incorporated throughout each unit as applicable.

-   contingency (two-way) frequency tables, their associated bar charts (including percentage segmented bar charts) and their use in identifying and describing associations between two categorical variables

-   back-to-back stem plots, parallel dot plots and boxplots and their use in identifying and describing associations between a numerical variable and a categorical variable

-   scatterplots and their use in identifying and qualitatively describing the association between two numerical variables in terms of direction (positive/negative), form (linear/non-linear) and strength (strong/moderate/weak)

-   answering statistical questions that require a knowledge of the associations between pairs of variables

-   Pearson correlation coefficient, $r$, and its calculation and interpretation

-   cause and effect; the difference between observation and experimentation when collecting data and the need for experimentation to definitively determine cause and effect.

Investigating and modelling linear associations

This topic includes:

-   least squares line of best fit $y = a + bx$, where $x$ represents the explanatory variable, and $y$ represents the response variable; the determination of the coefficients $a$ and$\ b$ using technology, and the formulas $b = r\ \frac{s_{y}}{s_{x}}\ \ $and $a = \overline{y} - b\overline{x}$

-   numerical smoothing of time series data using moving means with consideration of the number of terms required (using centring when appropriate) to help identify trends in time series plot with large fluctuations

-   graphical smoothing of time series plots using moving medians (involving an odd number of points only) to help identify long-term trends in time series with large fluctuations

-   seasonal adjustment including the use and interpretation of seasonal indices and their calculation using seasonal and yearly means

-   modelling trend by fitting a least squares line to a time series with time as the explanatory variable (data de-seasonalised where necessary), and the use of the model to make forecasts (with re-seasonalisation where necessary) including consideration of the possible limitations of fitting a linear model and the limitations of extending into the future.[]{#_Toc45611025 .anchor}

[]{#_Toc71028394 .anchor}School-based assessment

Satisfactory completion

The award of satisfactory completion for a unit is based on whether the student has demonstrated the set of outcomes specified for the unit. Teachers should use a variety of learning activities and assessment tasks to provide a range of opportunities for students to demonstrate the key knowledge and key skills in the outcomes.

The areas of study and key knowledge and key skills listed for the outcomes should be used for course design and the development of learning activities and assessment tasks.

Assessment of levels of achievement

The student's level of achievement for Units 3 and 4 will be determined by School-assessed Coursework.

School-assessed Coursework tasks must be a part of the regular teaching and learning program and must not unduly add to the workload associated with that program. They must be completed mainly in class and within a limited timeframe.

Where teachers provide a range of options for the same School-assessed Coursework task, they should ensure that the options are of comparable scope and demand.

The types and range of forms of School-assessed Coursework for the outcomes are prescribed within the study design. The VCAA publishes Support materials for this study, which includes advice on the design of assessment tasks and the assessment of student work for a level of achievement.

Teachers will provide to the VCAA a numerical score representing an assessment of the student's level of achievement. The score must be based on the teacher's assessment of the performance of each student on the tasks set out in the following table.

Contribution to final assessment

Unit 3

School-assessed Coursework for Unit 3 will contribute 24 per cent to the study score.

The **Application task** is a guided investigation of a given data set with several variables. The task has three components of increasing complexity:

-   the construction, description and interpretation of data plots, including smoothed plots where time series data is used

-   the calculation and interpretation of summary statistics, including seasonal indices and their application where time series data is used

-   the modelling of linear associations, or trends where time series data is used, including the use of data transformation as appropriate.

The application task is to be of 4--6 hours' duration over a period of 1--2 weeks.

[]{#_Toc71028395 .anchor}External assessment

The level of achievement for Units 3 and 4 is also assessed by two end-of-year examinations.

Contribution to final assessment

The examinations will contribute 60 per cent to the study score. Each examination will contribute 30 per cent to the study score.

End-of-year examinations

Description

The examinations will be set by a panel appointed by the VCAA. All of the content from the areas of study and the key knowledge and key skills that underpin the outcomes in Units 3 and 4 are examinable.

Examination 1

This examination comprises multiple-choice questions covering all areas of study. The examination is designed to assess students' knowledge of mathematical concepts, models and techniques and their ability to reason, interpret and apply this knowledge in a range of contexts.

Examination 2

This examination comprises written response questions covering all areas of study. The examination will be designed to assess students' ability to select and apply mathematical facts, concepts, models and techniques to solve extended application problems in a range of contexts.

Conditions

The examinations will be completed under the following conditions:

-   Duration: 1.5 hours.

-   Student access to an approved technology with numerical, graphical, symbolic, financial and statistical functionality will be assumed. One [bound reference](https://www.vcaa.vic.edu.au/assessment/vce-assessment/materials/Pages/index.aspx) text (which may be annotated) or lecture pad may be brought into the examination.

-   Date: end-of-year, on a date to be published annually by the VCAA.

-   VCAA examination rules will apply. Details of these rules are published annually in the [*VCE and VCAL Administrative Handbook.*](https://www.vcaa.vic.edu.au/administration/vce-vcal-handbook/Pages/index.aspx)

-   The examination will be marked by assessors appointed by the VCAA.

Further advice

The VCAA publishes specifications for all VCE examinations on the VCAA website. Examination specifications include details about the sections of the examination, their weighting, the question format(s) and any other essential information. The specifications are published in the first year of implementation of the revised Unit 3 and 4 sequence together with any sample material.

Mathematical Methods Units 3 and 4 extend the introductory study of simple elementary functions of a single real variable, to include combinations of these functions, algebra, calculus, probability and statistics, and their applications in a variety of practical and theoretical contexts. Units 3 and 4 consist of the areas of study 'Algebra, number and structure', 'Data analysis, probability and statistics', 'Calculus', and 'Functions, relations and graphs', which must be covered in progression from Unit 3 to Unit 4, with an appropriate selection of content for each of Unit 3 and Unit 4. Assumed knowledge and skills for Mathematical Methods Units 3 and 4 are contained in Mathematical Methods Units 1 and 2, and will be drawn on, as applicable, in the development of related content from the areas of study, and key knowledge and key skills for the outcomes of Mathematical Methods Units 3 and 4.

For Unit 3 a selection of content would typically include the areas of study 'Functions, relations and graphs' and 'Algebra, number and structure', applications of derivatives and differentiation, and identifying and analysing key features of the functions and their graphs from the 'Calculus' area of study. For Unit 4, a corresponding selection of content would typically consist of remaining content from 'Functions, relations and graphs', 'Algebra, number and structure' and 'Calculus' areas of study, and the study of random variables, discrete and continuous probability distributions, and the distribution of sample proportions from the 'Data analysis, probability and statistics' area of study. For Unit 4, the content from the 'Calculus' area of study would be likely to include the treatment of anti-differentiation, integration, the relation between integration and the area of regions specified by lines or curves described by the rules of functions, and simple applications of this content, including to probability distributions of continuous random variables.

The selection of content from the areas of study should be constructed so that there is a development in the complexity and sophistication of problem types and mathematical processes used (modelling, transformations, graph sketching and equation solving) in application to contexts related to these areas of study. There should be a clear progression of skills and knowledge from Unit 3 to Unit 4 in an area of study.

In undertaking these units, students are expected to be able to apply techniques, routines and processes involving rational and real arithmetic, sets, lists and tables, diagrams and geometric constructions, algorithms, algebraic manipulation, equations, graphs, differentiation, anti-differentiation, integration and inference, with and without the use of technology. They should have facility with relevant mental and by-hand approaches to estimation and computation.

[]{#_Toc71028402 .anchor}School-based assessment

Satisfactory completion

The award of satisfactory completion for a unit is based on whether the student has demonstrated the set of outcomes specified for the unit. Teachers should use a variety of learning activities and assessment tasks to provide a range of opportunities for students to demonstrate the key knowledge and key skills in the outcomes.

The areas of study and key knowledge and key skills listed for the outcomes should be used for course design and the development of learning activities and assessment tasks.

Assessment of levels of achievement

The student's level of achievement for Units 3 and 4 will be determined by School-assessed Coursework.

School-assessed Coursework tasks must be a part of the regular teaching and learning program and must not unduly add to the workload associated with that program. They must be completed mainly in class and within a limited timeframe.

Where teachers provide a range of options for the same School-assessed Coursework task, they should ensure that the options are of comparable scope and demand.

The types and range of forms of School-assessed Coursework for the outcomes are prescribed within the study design. The VCAA publishes Support materials for this study, which includes advice on the design of assessment tasks and the assessment of student work for a level of achievement.

Teachers will provide to the VCAA a numerical score representing an assessment of the student's level of achievement. The score must be based on the teacher's assessment of the performance of each student on the tasks set out in the following table.

Contribution to final assessment

School-assessed Coursework for Unit 3 will contribute 20 per cent to the study score.

The level of achievement for Units 3 and 4 is also assessed by two end-of-year examinations.

Contribution to final assessment

Examination 1 will contribute 20 per cent to the study score and Examination 2 will contribute 40 per cent to the study score.

End-of-year examinations

Description

The examinations will be set by a panel appointed by the VCAA. All of the content from the areas of study and the key knowledge and key skills that underpin the outcomes in Units 3 and 4 are examinable.

Examination 1

This examination comprises short-answer and some extended-answer questions covering all areas of study in relation to Outcome 1. It is designed to assess students' knowledge of mathematical concepts, their skills in carrying out mathematical algorithms without the use of technology and their ability to apply concepts and skills.

Conditions

The examination will be completed under the following conditions:

-   Duration: 1 hour.

-   No technology (calculators or software) or notes of any kind are permitted. A sheet of formulas will be provided with the examination.

-   Date: end-of-year, on a date to be published annually by the VCAA.

-   VCAA examination rules will apply. Details of these rules are published annually in the [*VCE and VCAL Administrative Handbook.*](https://www.vcaa.vic.edu.au/administration/vce-vcal-handbook/Pages/index.aspx)

-   The examination will be marked by assessors appointed by the VCAA.

Examination 2

This examination comprises multiple-choice questions and extended-answer questions covering all areas of the study in relation to all three outcomes, with an emphasis on Outcome 2. The examination is designed to assess students' ability to understand and communicate mathematical ideas, and to interpret, analyse and solve both routine and non-routine problems.

Conditions

The examination will be completed under the following conditions:

-   Duration: 2 hours.

-   Student access to an approved technology with numerical, graphical, symbolic and statistical functionality will be assumed.

-   One [bound reference](https://www.vcaa.vic.edu.au/assessment/vce-assessment/materials/Pages/index.aspx) text (which may be annotated) or lecture pad may be brought into the examination.

-   Date: end-of-year, on a date to be published annually by the VCAA.

-   VCAA examination rules will apply. Details of these rules are published annually in the [*VCE and VCAL Administrative Handbook*.](https://www.vcaa.vic.edu.au/administration/vce-vcal-handbook/Pages/index.aspx)

Further advice

The VCAA publishes specifications for all VCE examinations on the VCAA website. Examination specifications include details about the sections of the examination, their weighting, the question format(s) and any other essential information. The specifications are published in the first year of implementation of the revised Unit 3 and 4 sequence together with any sample material.

[]{#_Toc71028404 .anchor}Units 3 and 4: Specialist Mathematics

Specialist Mathematics Units 3 and 4 consist of the areas of study: 'Algebra, number and structure', 'Calculus', 'Data analysis, probability and statistics', 'Discrete mathematics', 'Functions, relations and graphs', and 'Space and measurement'. The development of course content should highlight mathematical structure, reasoning and proof and applications across a range of modelling contexts with an appropriate selection of content for each of Unit 3 and Unit 4. The selection of content for Unit 3 and Unit 4 should be constructed so that there is a balanced and progressive development of knowledge and skills with connections among the areas of study being developed as appropriate across Unit 3 and Unit 4.

Specialist Mathematics Units 3 and 4 assumes familiarity with the key knowledge and key skills from Mathematical Methods Units 1 and 2; the key knowledge and key skills from Specialist Mathematics Units 1 and 2; and concurrent study or previous completion of Mathematical Methods Units 3 and 4. Together these cover the assumed knowledge and skills for Specialist Mathematics Units 3 and 4, which are drawn on as applicable in the development of content from the areas of study and key knowledge and key skills for the outcomes.

For Unit 3 a selection of content would typically include content from the 'Discrete mathematics', 'Functions, relations and graphs', 'Algebra, number and structure', 'Space and measurement' and 'Calculus' areas of study. In Unit 4 the corresponding selection of content would typically consist of the remaining content from the 'Discrete mathematics', 'Calculus', and 'Space and measurement' areas of study and the content from the 'Data analysis, probability and statistics' area of study.

In undertaking these units, students are expected to be able to apply techniques, routines and processes involving rational, real and complex arithmetic, sets, lists, tables and vectors, diagrams and geometric constructions, algorithms, algebraic manipulation, equations, graphs, differentiation, anti-differentiation and integration and inference, with and without the use of technology. They should have facility with relevant mental and by-hand approaches to estimation and computation. The use of numerical, graphical, geometric, symbolic and statistical functionality of technology for teaching and learning mathematics, for working mathematically, and in related assessment, is to be incorporated throughout each unit as applicable.

Discrete mathematics

Logic and proof

In this area of study students cover the development of mathematical argument and proof. This includes conjectures, connectives, quantifiers, examples and counter-examples, and proof techniques including mathematical induction. Proofs will involve concepts from topics such as: divisibility, inequalities, graph theory, combinatorics, sequences and series including partial sums and partial products and related notations, complex numbers, matrices, vectors and calculus. The concepts, skills and processes from this area of study are to be applied in the other areas of study.

This area of study includes:

-   conjecture -- making a statement to be proved or disproved

-   implications, equivalences and if and only if statements (necessary and sufficient conditions)

-   natural deduction and proof techniques: direct proofs using a sequence of direct implications, proof by cases, proof by contradiction, and proof by contrapositive

-   quantifiers 'for all' and 'there exists', examples and counter-examples

-   proof by mathematical induction.

Functions, relations and graphs

In this area of study students cover rational functions and other simple quotient functions, curve sketching of these functions and relations, and the analysis of key features of their graphs including intercepts, asymptotic behaviour and the nature and location of stationary points and points of inflection and symmetry.

This area of study includes:

-   rational functions and the expression of rational functions of low degree as sums of partial fractions

-   graphs of rational functions of low degree, their asymptotic behaviour, and the nature and location of stationary points and points of inflection

-   graphs of simple quotient functions, their asymptotic behaviour, and the nature and location of stationary points and points of inflection.

Algebra, number and structure

Complex numbers

In this area of study students cover the algebra of complex numbers, including polar form, factorisation of polynomial functions over the complex field and an informal treatment of the fundamental theorem of algebra.

This area of study includes:

-   De Moivre's theorem, proof for integral powers, powers and roots of complex numbers in polar form, and their geometric representation and interpretation

-   the $n\ th\ $ roots of unity and other complex numbers and their location in the complex plane

-   factors over *C*, of polynomials; and introduction to the fundamental theorem of algebra, including\
    its application to factorisation of polynomial functions of a single variable over *C*, for example,\
    $z^{8} + 1,\ z^{2} - i$ or $z^{3} - (2 - i)z^{2} + z - 2 + i$

-   solution over *C* of polynomial equations by completing the square, use of the quadratic factorisation and the conjugate root theorem.

[]{#_Toc71028412 .anchor}School-based assessment

Satisfactory completion

The award of satisfactory completion for a unit is based on whether the student has demonstrated achievement of the set of outcomes specified for the unit. Teachers should use a variety of learning activities and assessment tasks to provide a range of opportunities for students to demonstrate the key knowledge and key skills in the outcomes.

The areas of study and key knowledge and key skills listed for the outcomes should be used for course design and the development of learning activities and assessment tasks.

Assessment of levels of achievement

The student's level of achievement for Units 3 and 4 will be determined by School-assessed Coursework.

School-assessed Coursework tasks must be a part of the regular teaching and learning program and must not unduly add to the workload associated with that program. They must be completed mainly in class and within a limited timeframe.

Where teachers provide a range of options for the same School-assessed Coursework task, they should ensure that the options are of comparable scope and demand.

The types and range of forms of School-assessed Coursework for the outcomes are prescribed within the study design. The VCAA publishes Support materials for this study, which includes advice on the design of assessment tasks and the assessment of student work for a level of achievement.

Teachers will provide to the VCAA a numerical score representing an assessment of the student's level of achievement. The score must be based on the teacher's assessment of the performance of each student on the tasks set out in the following table.

Contribution to final assessment

School-assessed Coursework for Unit 3 will contribute 20 per cent to the study score.

The level of achievement for Units 3 and 4 is also assessed by two end-of-year examinations.

Contribution to final assessment

Examination 1 will contribute 20 per cent to the study score and Examination 2 will contribute 40 per cent to the study score.

End-of-year examinations

Description

The examinations will be set by a panel appointed by the VCAA. All of the content from the areas of study and the key knowledge and key skills that underpin the outcomes in Units 3 and 4 are examinable.

Examination 1

This examination comprises short-answer and some extended-answer questions covering all areas of study in relation to Outcome 1. It is designed to assess students' knowledge of mathematical concepts, their skills in carrying out mathematical algorithms without the use of technology and their ability to apply concepts and skills.

The examination will be completed under the following conditions:

-   Duration: 1 hour.

-   No technology (calculators or software) or notes of any kind are permitted. A sheet of formulas will be provided with the examination.

-   Date: end-of-year, on a date to be published annually by the VCAA.

-   VCAA examination rules will apply. Details of these rules are published annually in the [*VCE and VCAL Administrative Handbook.*](https://www.vcaa.vic.edu.au/administration/vce-vcal-handbook/Pages/index.aspx)

-   The examination will be marked by assessors appointed by the VCAA.

Examination 2

This examination comprises multiple-choice questions and extended-answer questions covering all areas of the study in relation to all three outcomes, with an emphasis on Outcome 2. The examination is designed to assess students' ability to understand and communicate mathematical ideas, and to interpret, analyse and solve both routine and non-routine problems.

Conditions

The examination will be completed under the following conditions:

-   Duration: 2 hours.

-   Student access to an approved technology with numerical, graphical, symbolic and statistical functionality will be assumed.

-   One [bound reference](https://www.vcaa.vic.edu.au/assessment/vce-assessment/materials/Pages/index.aspx) text (which may be annotated) or lecture pad may be brought into the examination.

-   Date: end-of-year, on a date to be published annually by the VCAA.

-   VCAA examination rules will apply. Details of these rules are published annually in the [*VCE and VCAL Administrative Handbook.*](https://www.vcaa.vic.edu.au/administration/vce-vcal-handbook/Pages/index.aspx)
