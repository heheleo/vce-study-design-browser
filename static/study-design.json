The areas of study for Foundation Mathematics Unit 1 are 'Algebra, number and structure', 'Data analysis, probability and statistics', 'Discrete mathematics', and 'Space and measurement'. The content should be developed using contexts present in students' other studies, work and personal or other familiar situations.In undertaking these units, students are expected to be able to apply techniques, routines and processes involving integer, rational and real arithmetic, sets, lists and tables, contemporary data displays, diagrams, plans, geometric objects and constructions, algorithms, measures, equations and graphs, with and without the use of technology. They should have facility with relevant mental and by-hand approaches to estimation and computation. The use of numerical, graphical, geometric, symbolic, statistical and financial functionality of technology for teaching and learning mathematics, for working mathematically, and in related assessment, is to be incorporated throughout each unit as applicable.",
