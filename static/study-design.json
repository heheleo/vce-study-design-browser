They are also designed as preparation for Foundation Mathematics Units 3 and 4 and contain assumed knowledge and skills for these units.In Unit 1 students consolidate mathematical foundations, further develop their knowledge and capability to plan and conduct activities independently and collaboratively, communicate their mathematical ideas, and acquire mathematical knowledge skills to make informed decisions in their lives. The areas of study for Foundation Mathematics Unit 1 are 'Algebra, number and structure', 'Data analysis, probability and statistics', 'Discrete mathematics', and 'Space and measurement'. The content should be developed using contexts present in students' other studies, work and personal or other familiar situations.In undertaking these units, students are expected to be able to apply techniques, routines and processes involving integer, rational and real arithmetic, sets, lists and tables, contemporary data displays, diagrams, plans, geometric objects and constructions, algorithms, measures, equations and graphs, with and without the use of technology. They should have facility with relevant mental and by-hand approaches to estimation and computation. The use of numerical, graphical, geometric, symbolic, statistical and financial functionality of technology for teaching and learning mathematics, for working mathematically, and in related assessment, is to be incorporated throughout each unit as applicable.",

Study of Specialist Mathematics Units 3 and 4 also assumes concurrent study or previous completion of Mathematical Methods Units 3 and 4.The areas of study for Specialist Mathematics Units 1 and 2 are 'Algebra, number and structure', 'Data analysis, probability and statistics', 'Discrete mathematics', 'Functions, relations and graphs' and 'Space and measurement'.At the end of Unit 1 students are expected to have covered the material in the areas of study: 'Algebra, number and structure' and 'Discrete mathematics'. Concepts from these areas of study will be further developed and used in Unit 2 and also in Units 3 and 4.In undertaking this unit, students are expected to be able to apply techniques, routines and processes involving rational, real and complex arithmetic, sets, lists, tables and matrices, diagrams, graphs, logic gates and geometric constructions, algorithms, algebraic manipulation, recurrence relations, equations and graphs, with and without the use of technology. They are expected to be able to construct proofs and develop and interpret algorithms to solve problems. They should have facility with relevant mental and by-hand approaches to estimation and computation. The use of numerical, graphical, geometric, symbolic and statistical functionality of technology for teaching and learning mathematics, for working mathematically, and in related assessment, is to be incorporated throughout each unit as applicable.",
